# embedded_systems
This repository contains a collection of personal projects, experiments, and notes as part of my self-study journey in embedded systems. Each project includes code, documentation, and explanations to help reinforce key concepts and demonstrate practical applications using microcontrollers, sensors, and real-time systems.
